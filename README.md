# Date-grading
Date grading using rule-based fuzzy inference system

Three date quality parameters including the quantity of juice, size and freshness were measured for 100 date fruits in one orchard. These dates were graded by both a human expert and a fuzzy inference system designed for this purpose. Grading results obtained from fuzzy system showed 86% general conformity with the results from the human expert.
